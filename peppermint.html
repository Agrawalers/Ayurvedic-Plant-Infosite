                <p>
                    Peppermint plants grow to be 2–3 feet tall and have dark green leaves that grow opposite white flowers. The stems are square and reddish-green, and may have fine hairs. 
Peppermint leaves have a strong, sweetish odor and a warm, pungent taste with a  cooling aftertaste. 
Peppermint essential oils contain menthol, menthone, and other compounds.

                <h2>PROPERTIES AND USES</h2>
                <p>Peppermint is a common flavoring in foods and drinks, such as ice cream, lemonade, and cocktails. 
                    Peppermint oil is used as a fragrance in soaps and cosmetics. 
                    Peppermint has been used for health purposes for thousands of years. Some of its potential health benefits include: 
                    Peppermint may help with indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and stomach pain. 
                    Peppermint's antimicrobial properties may help fight off the common cold and sinus infections. 
                    Peppermint oil may help with headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, and itching. 
                    Peppermint's menthol may help ease the intensity and shorten the length of period pain. 
                    Peppermint oil may boost blood flow to the scalp, which may help with hair growth. Peppermint oil may help soothe skin irritation and inflammation, and fight acne-causing bacteria. 
                    Peppermint can repel some pest insects, including mosquitos, and is used in organic gardening. 
                   Peppermint is widely used to repel rodents.

            <H2>PRECAUTIONS</H2>
            <p>Peppermint can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, worsening symptoms like heartburn or acid reflux. Avoid peppermint if you have GERD.
                Although peppermint is generally safe, high doses can trigger uterine relaxation, possibly increasing the risk of miscarriage. Always consult a healthcare provider before use.
                Peppermint can exacerbate gallbladder issues, including gallstones, due to its effect on bile flow. Avoid use if you have gallbladder problems.
                Peppermint oil can cause breathing issues or spasms if applied directly to a child’s or infant’s face. Use diluted forms and avoid applying near the face.
                Peppermint may interfere with certain medications like antacids, blood pressure medications, or cyclosporine. Consult a doctor if you're on these drugs.
                Some people may experience allergic reactions such as rashes, headaches, or respiratory symptoms. Discontinue use if any allergic signs appear.
                Excessive use, particularly of peppermint oil, can lead to nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort. Stick to recommended dosages.
