                <H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
                <p>
                    Tulsi, also known as Holy Basil, is a perennial herb or shrub 
                    Tulsi is a small, aromatic, and much branched shrub with hairy stems and                    simple, toothed leaves. The leaves can be green or purple, depending on the                 variety. The flowers are small, tubular, and purple or white, with green or                 purple sepals. 
                     Tulsi can grow up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) in height. 
                    Tulsi is native to India and Southeast Asia
                    Tulsi can grow in full sun or partial shade, but it produces more oil when                  grown in full sun. 
                    Tulsi grows best in well-drained, aerated soil with good organic matter and a pH range of 5.5â€“7. Avoid sticky, clay-like soil. 
                    Tulsi needs regular watering, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. 
                    Tulsi grows well in long days and high temperatures. Tulsi flourishes well                  in humid conditions and fairly high rainfall. 
                    Tulsi can be attacked by pests like mealy bugs, aphids, spider mites, and                   whiteflies. You can treat pests with a neem-based organic pesticide or                  insecticidal soap. 
                    Regular pruning promotes bushy growth. 
                    Protect the plants from frost during colder months
