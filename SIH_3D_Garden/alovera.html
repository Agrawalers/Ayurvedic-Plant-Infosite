                <H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
                <p>Aloe vera is a perennial, succulent plant (meaning its leaves hold large quantities of water). The plant can grow up to 4 feet tall, and its tough, fleshy, spear like leaves can grow up to 36 inches long. 
                    The clear, thick gel found in the inner part of the leaf is most commonly used for minor cuts and burns.
                    It grows mainly in the dry regions of Africa, Asia, Europe and America. In India, it is found in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
                     Aloe vera plants need to be housed in a bright location with some direct sun in winter months. An odd fact about aloe vera is it can sunburn just like us. If you move an aloe vera into direct sunlight from a relatively shady location, the sun can do harm.
                    An appropriate way to water an aloe vera plant is to water thoroughly and let the excess water drain. Then, water again when the top inch of soil is dry. This allows for optimal aloe vera growth. 
                    An indication that your aloe vera plant is not receiving enough water is brown leaf tips. However, a more common indication of improper watering is black spots on the leaves due to overwatering. Overwatering can be more dangerous than under watering because it could lead to root rot. 
                    The aloe vera plant can live in temperatures from 50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. When growing aloe vera indoors, room temperatures of 60â€“75 degrees Fahrenheit are preferred for optimal plant growth.
                    Aloe can occasionally be infested with Aceria aloinis, commonly referred to as aloe mite. These mites are nearly invisible to the human eye. Under a microscope, people can identify this scheming mite as worm-like. 
                    While problems are rare because they are an easy-going plant, overwatering is one of the most common sources of improper aloe vera plant care.

                <h2>PROPERTIES AND USES</h2>
                <p> Aloe vera gel can be applied topically to treat a variety of skin conditions, such as acne, burns, cold sores, insect bites, psoriasis, and sunburn. Aloe vera contains chemicals that can reduce redness, swelling, and itching, and promote new skin cell growth. 
                    Aloe vera can help with gastrointestinal disorders like gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Aloe vera syrup can reduce the frequency of symptoms like heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Aloe vera is also considered a natural laxative that can help prevent constipation. 
                    Aloe vera contains antioxidants that can help boost your immune system. 
                     Some preliminary evidence suggests that aloe vera gel may help lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes. 
                    Some preliminary evidence suggests that aloe vera gel may help stabilize metastatic cancer. 
                    Some preliminary evidence suggests that aloe vera gel may help treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.
                    Aloe vera contains active compounds that may reduce pain and inflammation.

            <H2>PRECAUTIONS</H2>
            <p>Aloe gel is generally safe when applied to the skin, but you should avoid applying it to open or deep wounds. It can cause an allergic reaction, such as a rash, in rare cases. If you develop a rash, stop using the gel. 
                Taking aloe latex or whole-leaf extract orally is not recommended, especially in high doses. Aloe latex can cause severe intestinal cramps, diarrhea, and kidney damage. It can also potentially cause cancer. Pregnant women and nursing mothers should not take aloe latex. 
                People with diabetes who take medicines to lower their blood sugar should not take oral aloe vera. Aloe can lower your blood sugar too much. 
                You should not take aloe by mouth if you have stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. Aloe is a laxative and could make your symptoms worse. Aloe latex and whole-leaf extract are not safe for children under 12.
