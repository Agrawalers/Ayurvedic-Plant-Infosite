                <H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
                <p>
                    Murraya koenigii, called curry leaf, is a small, tropical to sub-tropical tree or shrub that typically grows to 6-15' tall and is noted for its pungent, aromatic, curry leaves which are an important flavoring used in Indian/Asian cuisine. This tree is native to moist forests in India and Sri Lanka.
                    Curry leaf plants prefer full sun to partial shade, especially during the summer. They should receive at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight per day. 
                    Curry leaf plants need well-drained soil that doesn't dry out. A mix of potting soil, small bark, and perlite works well. 
                    Curry leaf plants should be watered moderately, allowing the top inch or two of soil to dry out between waterings. 
                     Curry leaf plants prefer warm temperatures between 65°F to 90°F. 
                     Curry leaf plants should be planted away from the wind. In colder climates, they can be grown against a north or west facing wall to create a warm microclimate.
